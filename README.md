## Overview
      Analysts inspected New York City Citibike data from August 2019 in order to determine if Citibikes
      would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The NYC data was analyzed to show trends for times of day, 
      days of the week, gender, starting locations, and ending locations. This analysis required analysts to 
      used Pandas to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Using the converted 
      datatype, visualizations were created to show the length of time the bikes are checkout for all riders and 
      genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, show 
      the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, top starting locations, and 
      top ending locations.
